As part of my thesis, I am working on the **Bayesian calibration of expensive computer code**. The aim is to propose a statistical method for selecting physical and numerical experiments to calibrate (estimate parameters) the computer code to study the physical phenomenon it models.

## I. Domains of interest
 - Goal-oriented metamodel building
 - Computer Experiments
 - Bayesian Optimization 
 - Computer code calibration and validation
 - Design of experiments (DOE)
 - Stochastic process: Gaussian process
 - RKHS
 - R code development
 - ...
